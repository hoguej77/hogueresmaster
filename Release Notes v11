📜 HogueResMaster — Full Change Log (v1 → v11)

v11 (current)
	•	🚀 Auto-start intake (no manual “run” command); all-at-once or step-by-step uploads.
	•	🎛️ Style Pack with auto-suggest + multi-select override: Classic / Hybrid / Technical Individual Contributor / Executive / Healthcare / Federal / Academic Curriculum Vitae.
	•	💌 Evidence-only cover letters (warm/professional/direct): cites real wins; no clichés; no invented claims. Accomplishment Nudge asks for metrics if missing.
	•	🏛️ Federal (USAJOBS) mode: “11:59 p.m. Eastern Time” reminder, cut-off detection, Specialized Experience alignment, Month/Year + Hours/Week checks, USAJOBS checklist + badge.
	•	🔒 ATS-safe composition (Applicant Tracking System): single column; no tables/columns/text boxes; clean page breaks; consistent bullets; acronyms expanded once.
	•	🛡️ Risk & salary awareness: flags up-front fees / Telegram-only / fake checks / crypto tasks; JOFDAV awareness; salary-transparency nudge when relevant.
	•	🖼️ OCR fallback for screenshots and image-only PDFs (best effort; friendly nudge if engine missing).
	•	🔗 Link health check for Interview Guide and Run Report (never modifies the resume).
	•	🅱️ A/B bullet variant + de-dup + tighten (≤6 bullets per role; 1–2 lines each).
	•	🧷 Style memory (remembers last selections).
	•	🔁 Idempotent runs (skips rebuild if inputs/options unchanged).

	•	🧾 Output engines: DOCX canonical; PDF when available; RTF fallback (no plain .txt).

🗒️ Notes (Principles • Compatibility • Privacy)

Principles
	•	ATS-first, human-friendly: single column, clean spacing, consistent bullets, clear page breaks.
	•	Evidence-only: never fabricate achievements; if metrics are missing, we ask for them (Accomplishment Nudge).
	•	Clarity: expand acronyms on first mention (e.g., Applicant Tracking System (ATS)), then keep them short.

Compatibility
	•	Best with DOCX and PDF; RTF fallback ensures universal openability without losing structure.
	•	OCR improves screenshot parsing when available; otherwise users get a polite nudge to upload a text-based file.

Privacy
	•	ATS copy hides phone number and street address by default (you can switch this off).
	•	No analytics required to generate documents.

Accessibility
	•	Clean, single-column structure improves screen-reader parsing; body text in readable sizes by default.

⸻

🥊 Why HogueResMaster is better than the competition
	•	ATS-safe by design (not “pretty” templates that break parsing).
	•	Authentic cover letters grounded in your actual results and the job’s needs; no clichés, no invented claims.
	•	Federal (USAJOBS) awareness done properly: Month/Year + Hours/Week prompts, Specialized Experience mapping, closing-time reminders, badge + checklist.
	•	Mobile-first delivery: organized ZIP folders and a mini README for iPhone/Android.
	•	Safety built-in: scam flags and salary-transparency nudges.
	•	Productivity: optional A/B bullet variant and idempotent runs save time without sacrificing quality.

🛣️ Future Updates (Roadmap)

Near-term (v11.x)
	•	Embedded fonts for PDFs (identical rendering across devices when the engine is present).
	•	Accessibility quick-toggle (larger text, higher-contrast bullets).
	•	Localization-ready strings for Spanish and other languages.
	•	Session restore (resume where you left off).
	•	One-Tap Re-Run (reuse resume + style across a short list of postings in one session).
	•	Style Pack additions (Modern Legal, Government Contractor), still ATS-safe.

Mid-term (v12)
	•	Optional job-API connectors (user-authorized) to fetch postings directly.
	•	“I Trust” watermark option (off by default) for those who want a discreet authenticity marker.
	•	Metrics helper to convert responsibilities into measurable outcomes.
	•	Local run analytics (before→after charts; no external servers).
	•	Interactive Review: accept/rewrite bullets inline before export.
